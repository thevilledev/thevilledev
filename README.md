Short background:

- I started my FOSS journey in 2005, building various RPM packages as a community effort for Fedora Core. Good times.
- Built and scaled highly available infrastructure for organizations ranging from startups to enterprise, specializing in containers.
- 15+ years of hands-on experience on cloud technologies and container orchestration.
- Maintaining a dual focus on software development and infrastructure. Actively learning.
- As time passes, the more I seem to enjoy Functional Programming.

- HashiCorp Core Contributor 2024
- Original author of [Terraform Provider for UpCloud](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/terraform-provider-upcloud) as an OSS project, later adopted by the company
